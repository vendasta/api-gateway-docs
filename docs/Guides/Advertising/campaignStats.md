# Getting Advertising Campaign Stats

`Campaign Stats` are the stats of connected campaigns under one advertising account that has been connected to a specific Business Location in [Advertising Intelligence](https://support.vendasta.com/hc/en-us/articles/4406950929047).  In order to access campagin level information or stats, the Business Location must have advanced reporting enabled.

## Setup

Create an access token with `advertising` scopes following the [Authorization guide](../../Authorization/Authorization.md).

## Examples

### Fetching all Campaign Stats for a connected account
In order to fetch campaign stats for an account, you will need the ID of a Connected Account. 
> For info on Connected Advertising Accounts see the [Connected Accounts guide](./connectedAccount.md)
The ID will be in the format `AG-X5FZQG6T25:google:1324354698`
