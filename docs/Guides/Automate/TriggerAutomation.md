# Trigger a prebuilt automation

If you have setup automations in the Vendasta platform you can trigger them for a business. This enables you to set up a complex chain of actions but only need one api call. 

## Setup:

Create an access token with at least `business` scopes following the [Authorization guide](../../Authorization/Authorization.md).

Create an automation in the Vendasta platform with the "It's triggered via API" [trigger](https://support.vendasta.com/hc/en-us/articles/4406952880919-Automation-triggers).

## Step 1: Trigger the automation

<!--

title: Request
-->

You will need the ID of the automation you previously created as well as the [business ID](../Accounts.md) of the business location you would like to trigger that automation for. Add the access token to the headers and send it off. 

This api call has an empty response.
