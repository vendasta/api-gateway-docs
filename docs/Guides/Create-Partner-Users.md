        "greetingName": "Billy",
        "email": "bill@example.com",
        "languageLocaleCode": "en-US",
        "phoneNumbers": [
          {
            "number": "+1 306 555 1234 ext. 5",

              "id": "ssc:manage"
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

For full details on the available fields see the [API specification](../../openapi/platform/platform.yaml/components/schemas/users).

Creating a user by API does **not** send out a welcome email. You may build your own message or send ours in a later step of your process.


## Check for an existing user
If another user already exists within your platform with the same email address you will get an error when trying to create a new user. You can search for an existing user by email with the following request.

```json http
{
  "method": "get",
  "url": "https://prod.apigateway.co/platform/users",
  "query": {
    "filter[partner.id]": "",
    "filter[email]": "bill@example.com"
  },
  "headers": {
    "Authorization": "Bearer <Access Token with 'user.admin' scope>"
  }
}
```

# Comming Soon
Soon you will be able to manage your users via SCIM. Check out the [proposed APIs](../../openapi/scim/scim.yaml).
