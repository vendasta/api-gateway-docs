# Create a Partner User

When you hire a new employee they are going to need access to some of the platform features so they can start selling or fulfilling orders.


## Create a new user

When creating a new partner user you will need their email address and the IDs of the platform features that you would like to give them access to. 

The most common platform features are:

|ID|Description|
|--|-----------|
|pc:access|Allows the user to access the admin tools in partner center|
|pc:canManageSales|Access to manage salespeople, pipelines, and sales settings|
|tm:access|Provides access to Task Manager|
|tm:manage|Allows access to the management tools in Task Manager|

        "phoneNumbers": [
          {
            "number": "+1 306 555 1234 ext. 5",
            "typeCode": "mobile"

            "id": "ABC"
          }
        },
        "platformAccess": {
          "data": [
            {
              "type": "appFeatures",
              "id": "pc:access"
            },
            {
              "type": "appFeatures",
              "id": "tm:manage"
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

For full details on the available fields see the [API specification](../../openapi/platform/platform.yaml/components/schemas/users).

Creating a user by API does **not** send out a welcome email. You may build your own message or send the default welcome email in a later step of your process.

> The number of partner users you can have before needing to pay for extra seats depends on your subscription, so be aware of your limits prior to adding new seats over API. 


## Check for an existing user
If another user already exists within your platform with the same email address you will get an error when trying to create a new user. You can search for an existing user by email with the following request.

```json http
{
  "method": "get",
  "url": "https://prod.apigateway.co/platform/users",
  "query": {
    "filter[partner.id]": "",
    "filter[email]": "bill@example.com"
  },
  "headers": {
    "Authorization": "Bearer <Access Token with 'user.admin' scope>"
  }
}
```
