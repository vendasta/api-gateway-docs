# What would you like to do?

## Build an integration for yourself

Automate repetitive tasks within your Vendasta platform instance using our APIs. Create seamless workflows between your platform and ours for your clients!


**[Platform API](https://developers.vendasta.com/platform)**

This is the current standard for building integrations with the Vendasta platform. These APIs are now in *maitenance mode*. Beyond the CRM API there will be little further development on these APIs.

**gRPC reverse proxy api gateway**

*Coming Soon!*

Instead of integrating against external copies of the APIs that power the Vendasta platform, you'll gain access to every action available through the UI via our gRPC plugin. 


---

**[Legacy APIs](https://developers.vendasta.com/api/legacy)**

These are not recommended to be used for new integrations. If you already utilize these and require assistance, or need your API key, please contact support@vendasta.com

## SSO from your Platform to Vendasta
Allow your SMB users to seamlessly access Vendasta's white-label platform. You can authenticate them within your own platform and then use **OAuth2/OIDC single sign-on (SSO)** to grant access. This is a great option if your customers already have credentials stored in your system, as you can replace Vendasta's Business App login screens with your own by configuring **Identity Provider (IdP) SSO**. 

## Build an integration for your clients
Do you have an app which manages data for other businesses that you want to make seamlessly available to your clients through the Vendasta Business App? Then you will want to check out the Guide to [Building Producs & Services in the Platform](https://developers.vendasta.com/vendor/112210c5ddd88-configuring-your-products-and-services)  - [Example App Implementation](https://developers.vendasta.com/vendor/463ea876a888b-creating-new-vendor-application#creating-new-vendor-application).



## Test your integration in a sandbox
We provide a "demo" environment where you are free to test your integrations without worrying about messing up your data. Please contact support@vendasta.com to have an instance set up.
