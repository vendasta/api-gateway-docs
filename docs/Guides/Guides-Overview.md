# What would you like to do?

## Build an integration for yourself
Save your team time and money by automating many of the repetitive tasks they do within your own instance of the platform. 

Try out our new set of unified [Platform APIs](https://developers.vendasta.com/platform) which are currently in early access or make use of some of the [Legacy APIs](https://developers.vendasta.com/api/legacy) while we work.

## SSO from your Platform to Vendasta
Authenticate your users in your platform and let them access Vendasta's white-label platform through OpenID Connect OAuth2 single sign-on.

## Build an integration to sell
Do you have an app which manages data for other businesses that you want to sell? Then you will want to visit our [Product Integration Guides](https://developers.vendasta.com/vendors/getting-started). You are not required to be registered as a Vendor to use the same integrations for your own clients! Do you want to create a new app to integrate with Vendasta for your business? Check out an [Integration Example](https://developers.vendasta.com/vendor/463ea876a888b-creating-new-vendor-application#creating-new-vendor-application).

## Test your integration in a sandbox
We provide a "demo" environment where you are free to test your integrations without worrying about messing up your data. Please contact support@vendasta.com to have an instance set up.
