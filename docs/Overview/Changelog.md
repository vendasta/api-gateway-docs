### Business Categories optional
It is now optional to include business categories when creating a business location or sales account. They will be assigned a default category of "other".

## 2022-08-17

### List Partner Activatable Products

Listing the products a partner has enabled to be activated in their marketplace has been proposed. [View the details here.](../../openapi/platform/platform.yaml/paths/~1partnerActivatableProducts/get)


## 2022-08-08

### Proposal Builder
Create, update, get, and list operations added to Platform APIs along with description of [Proposal](../../openapi/platform/platform.yaml/components/schemas/proposals)

## 2022-07-22

### Customer Voice Template Management

Create, update, get, list and delete operations are now available for the [templates](../../openapi/customervoice/customervoice.yaml/components/schemas/reviewRequestTemplates) used in Customer Voice. This will allow you to customize the content of email and SMB messages used when sending requests for reviews using the Customer Voice product. 

### Delete from Customer List

The ability to [delete a contact](../../openapi/business/business.yaml/paths/~1customers~1{id}/delete) from Customer List has been added. 

## 2022-07-21

### Country and region lists

You may now get a list of the [country](../../openapi/platform/platform.yaml/paths/~1countries/get) and [region](../../openapi/platform/platform.yaml/paths/~1countryRegions/get) codes that are permitted when we validate addresses. The lists include their names allowing you to provide your users with dropdown lists. 

## 2022-07-18

### Customer List Management

List, update and get operations are now available for the [business customers resourse](../../openapi/business/business.yaml/components/schemas/customers). This allows for full management of the contacts added in Business App's customer list.


## 2022-06-23

### Create Sales Orders with Status

It is now possible to [create sales orders](../../openapi/platform/platform.yaml/paths/~1orders/post) that are not immediately sent for activation. You may set the `statusCode` to `submitted` to send the order to your partner admins for manual approval. Setting the `statusCode` to `draft` will create the order without sending it to anyone. 

### List Subscription Assignments

Using the new [list subscription assignments operation](../../openapi/platform/platform.yaml/paths/~1subscriptionAssignments/get) you can now determine what products have been activated for a business location. 

This allows you to check to see if a product is already active before submitting an order. 

"Why is it called a subscription assignment?" you might ask. Well, we are working on the ability for businesses to purchase multiple product subscriptions and then assign them to one or more locations. For seat-based products the subscriptions will be assignable to users. We still have a large amount of work to do to support this but we didn't want to make you switch APIs.

## 2022-05-18

Proposed new resources for managing subscription assignments.

## 2022-04-12

### Automations name

It is now possible to get the name of an automation if you already know it's name. More info can be found [here](/platform/d2d52201b76ca-get-automation).

### Standard hours of operation

The [businessLocations](/platform/fc461812db5c6-business-location) and [salesAccounts](/platform/af388f5a836f8-sales-account) resources now support setting and retrieving the general weekly standard hours for your locations. A format for holiday and department specific hours has been proposed as something we would like to add in the future. 

## 2022-04-05

### Custom Fields now support external Ids

The `salesAccountCustomFields`, `userCustomFields`, `productCustomFields`, and `orderCustomFields` resources have all been updated to have an `externalId` field.

You can customize the `externalId` in Partner Center. It can be used instead of the system generated `fieldId` when reading or setting the value for a custom field.

### Versioning Status Rename

The names and definitions of the maturity statuses used to define the stability level of API operations in our
[versioning policy](Versioning.md) have been clarified and aligned with those used for other Vendasta platform features.
There is no functional impact to your code.

### Address Fields Reconciled

The address related fields for the `businessLocations` resource have been reconciled with the new `users` resource
fields so that they use consistent field names and values.

For `businessLocations` the `zip` has been renamed `postalCode` to match international best practices.
As well the `stateCode` has been replaced with `regionCode` which follows the [ISO 3166-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO\_3166-2) format.
To migrate you can simply generate the value as `{countryCode}-{stateCode}`.

For `users` the `streetAddress` has been renamed `line1` and `additionalAddress` has been renamed `line2`.

The old fields will continue to work while the trusted tester partners using them are given a chance to migrate. (Targeting 30 days)
