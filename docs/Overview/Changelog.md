### Versioning Status Rename
The names and definitions of the maturity statuses used to define the stability level of API operations in our 
[versioning policy](Versioning.md) have been clarified and aligned with those used for other Vendasta platform features.
There is no functional impact to your code.

### Address Fields Reconciled
The address related fields for the `businessLocations` resource have been reconciled with the new `users` resource 
fields so that they use consistent field names and values.

For `businessLocations` the `zip` has been renamed `postalCode` to match international best practices.
As well the `stateCode` has been replaced with `regionCode` which follows the [ISO 3166-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-2) format.
To migrate you can simply generate the value as `{countryCode}-{stateCode}`.

For `users` the `streetAddress` has been renamed `line1` and `additionalAddress` has been renamed `line2`.

The old fields will continue to work while the trusted tester partners using them are given a chance to migrate. (Targeting 30 days)
