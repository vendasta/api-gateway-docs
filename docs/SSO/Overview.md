# Single Sign On (SSO)

SSO enables a user to use one set of credentials to log into many different sites and services. At Vendasta we use the industry-standard OAuth2 protocol to support this.

There are several different ways to set up SSO depending on your needs. Please complete one or more of the following guides.

## Identity Provider (IDP) SSO
Let a user access the Vendasta platform and marketplace apps by entering their username and password on your site. If you are a reseller partner this guide is for you.

## Service Provider (SP) SSO
Let users who are already logged into Vendasta access your site/app. If you are a vendor partner with a marketplace app this guide is for you.
