    description: |2-
       - ALIGN_NONE: No alignment.
       - ALIGN_DELTA: Align and convert to delta metric type. This alignment is valid
      for delta metrics. Aligning an existing delta metric to a delta metric
      requires that the alignment period be increased. The value type of the
      result is the same as the value type of the input.

      One can think of this aligner as a rate but without time units; that
      is, the output is conceptually (second_point - first_point).
       - ALIGN_INTERPOLATE: Align by interpolating between adjacent points around the
      period boundary. This alignment is valid for gauge
      metrics with numeric values. The value type of the result is the same
      as the value type of the input.
       - ALIGN_NEXT_OLDER: Align by shifting the oldest data point before the period
      boundary to the boundary. This alignment is valid for gauge
      metrics. The value type of the result is the same as the
      value type of the input.
       - ALIGN_EXACT: Align by using data points that fall on the same UTC day of the period boundary.
      This alignment is valid for daily gauge metrics.
      The value type of the result is the same as the value type of the input.
       - ALIGN_CUSTOM: Allows the user to specify custom alignment logic, allowing the query to make more complex decisions on which
      time/date bucket(s) a row should be placed in.
      This is useful when your table has multiple columns that need to be considered when bucketing rows into time
      buckets, such as a created and deleted date.
      The custom aligner allows you to bucket these rows based on their status at one of the bucket boundaries or
      within the bucket.

          alignment functions may be applied to all time series, depending
          on the metric type and value type of the original time
          series. Alignment may change the metric type or the value type of
          the time series.

          The existing legacy logic is currently:
          - end has a little over an one hour added to it
          - start and end are converted to the number of days, rounded down, from the current moment
          - rows are returned where (start of today - start day offsets) <= rowTime < (start of today - end day offsets)

        description: |-
          When date points are generated from the passed in date range, such when using the exact or custom aligners,
          exclusiveness is implemented as offsetting the boundary by a date period after truncating it to that date period
          ie. period of day, end_exclusive 2019-09-03T17:35:42 will truncate to 2019-09-03T00:00:00
          and then offset to 2019-09-02T00:00:00, so the last data point to be returned would be 2019-09-02T00:00:00

          Your boundaries will not be altered or aligned to day starts respecting the inclusiveness/exclusiveness
          of the boundary
